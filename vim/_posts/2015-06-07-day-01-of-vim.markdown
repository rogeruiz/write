My configuration of Sublime Text 3 is slowly dying. Over the course of being
used as my workhorse editor, I have installed way too many plugins into the
thing to keep it useful.

I am also getting bored of using it. Vim has always eluded me as a
choice as an editor. I have been intrigued so many times, and when I do
not have a choice, mostly when ssh'd in, it is something I look forward
to using.

This time, I am going to use Vim to manage my day to day code-editing.

#### The Catalyst and The Tinder

If I am going to do anything I am going to do it _right_. Some of my favorite
things about using a GUI editor are:

* That I can leave it open for days.
  * With multiple projects.
    * Across multiple quit sessions thanks to Mac OS Lion's update.

Yet, whenever I use the terminal, I am always at the mercy of the terminal's
PID. I do not want my editor to be at that same mercy. I only have experience
with Screen, but I have heard that Tmux is good so I am going to be using it
instead.

Now, this would not be fun without a little script. I am going to create a
Tmux & Vim wrapper for my terminal sessions that way I can also use the
session's attach and detach events to track my session's time. This is going to
help me manage my time a little better.
