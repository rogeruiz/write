I am web engineer specializing in client-side code. I find that there are many
pressures in writing good software — some internal, some external. I listen
carefully to the concerns of engineers and others involved in the decision-making
process – designers, clients, customers, and stakeholders. I foster relationships
while working with everyone to empathetically understand what drives certain
decisions in the early stages and throughout the life-cycle of software development
and support.

I have a strong passion for good software. User experience to me is something
that I think is too often ignored in products and I always have an opinion about
how it could be done better. Because end-user software is an abstraction and
combination of different concepts that a user may already be familiar with, it
is important to realize that users of said software come from many different
backgrounds and levels of expertise in so many different fields unrelated to
software engineering. User's of software fall into two large categories that can
be dissected further.

These two categories are:

1. Users who love your software because it is great, intuitive, and a pleasure to use.
2. Users who do not have any other choice.

With every piece of code I touch, I strive for the former because I have either
been in or witnessed users in that latter category all too often.
