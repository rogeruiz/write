## Allow me to introduce myself

I am a self-taught software developer that found my place in web development by
coming in through the window, specifically the browser window. Coming from a
traditional graphic design background, CSS and systems design were two things
that felt as natural as color theory and typography. As I learned more about the
history of and fundamentals of programming, I made my transition to full-stack
web development.

I view the projects I work on as umbrellas that cover or overlap many aspects of
how people interact with the government. Whether it's interagency interactions
like the [Open Opportunities platform] [openopps] or the [Federal Front Door]
[ffd] welcoming civilians into necessary interactions with the government, I see
the projects I am working on as a web that helps bring down walls around
information or shed light into perceived black box processes.

After years of working in the advertising industry, I wanted a change that would
make a real impact in the world using software. Instead of helping people
click-through to more content or change a ad-specific communication preference,
I want to change the way people have to interact with government services whether
it's tools used by federal agencies or by the American people.
