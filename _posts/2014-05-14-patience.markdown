<br>Patience. Patience, baby Rocket.

<br>That's what you'll need.
<br>It's a good thing to have plenty of.

<br>You never quite know
<br>when you'll use it. And,
<br>you never seem
<br>to have enough of it.

<br>But.
<br>But.
<br>But.

<br>The secret no one tells you is
<br>that patience
<br>is plentiful. It's always
<br>surrounding      you. Always.

<br>The clocks that tick
<br>are patient.
<br>The wheels that roll
<br>are patient.
<br>The flowers that sway &
<br>the folks that wait until payday.

<br>Patience is a feeling
<br>you only earn
<br>after you've felt
<br>it.

<br>So many things around you
<br>try to
<br>rob it
<br>from
<br>you.

<br>They try to remove it
<br>from life by
<br>showing you magic
<br>tricks.

<br>But, baby.
<br>Baby. That's just speed.
<br>An imperceptible patience.
