### Roger is working on a computer all the time

I started this [Tumblr][roger-is-working] about a week or two after I started
working at [18F][eighteenf]. This had been my second foray into remote-work life
and I was starting to really miss some of the aspects of checking into an office
building everyday and having living-breathing humans around me that weren't my
living-breathing family.

So I considered it important to start doing this **publicly**.

I had found out about `lolcommits` from the [Meetup's Hack && Tell]
[mu-hack-and-tell] in NYC back in 2011. I had been mesmerized by how simple the
concept of tagging your likeness to a commit would make for better signing of
commits than a GPG key. It made what I do on the computer more approachable.

I would tell friends that I hacked on something over the weekend, and didn't
have anything to show for it. It was either a script or a tweak to my system
that I couldn't really show off. But showing people a series of pictures taken
while I was working on said thing was always easier to show off. More human too.

So I continued from job to job and project to project collecting
`.lolcommit/*.jpg` along the way.

### That remote life

So once I moved from NYC to RVA with my new family, I found myself in a
predicament. Jobs in Richmond weren't all they were promised to be, and I
started looking for something else I could work with. So I did what I think most
people in my situation do. I started working remotely. Freelancing at first, and
finally landing my first full-time remote job at 18F.

This is when the real need for something like this came up. I needed a way to
both keep myself sane and express myself to my new coworkers. So I polished off
my `lolcommits` clone, merged with upstream, and found myself with all these
glorious plugins that hadn't always been available. [So I installed the Tumblr one
and wrote about how to set it up][setting-up-lolcommits].
