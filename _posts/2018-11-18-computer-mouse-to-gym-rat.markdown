I could have very easily started writing this 12 months ago. In November of 2017
I decided that I would start weight training as exercise. Previous to this
decision, my exercising was almost exclusively cardio exercises. That's not to
say they weren't making me strong, but the biggest thing they all had in common
was that they were all endurance exercises.

#### What do you endure

Endurance exercises easily become low effort activities. For instance, you train
to run a 5k and then a couple of months later, running a 5k is easy and you
challenge yourself by running an 8k. Your endurance is up so the only way to add
more volume or work to your workout is to extend it by distance. I'm not saying
they're necessarily easy, but they're different enough from strength training
that it's more popular to do endurance training than it is to do strength
training.
