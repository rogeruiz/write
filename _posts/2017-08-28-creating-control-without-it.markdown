title: Creating Control Without It

The idea here is to talk about how some of my most popular projects were created
during a time when I was experiencing a lot of external stress that was outside
of my control. Or at least outside of my immediate control.

In order to do the best to ignore my own feelings about it and cope, a coping
mechanism I've grown and fed is attempting to distract myself by solving a
problem that is an inconvenience with tools and technology that I barely
understand at the start. It's a one-two punch. I begin by researching the
problem. Then, I choose a tool or language I want to learn and teach myself that
too. It's sort of masochistic and sort of optimistic.

## Finding yourself in chaos

## Creating a problem

## Solving that problem

## Feeling accomplished enough to talk about it
