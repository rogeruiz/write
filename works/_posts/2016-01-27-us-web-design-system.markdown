### Description

The USWDS is a design system for the federal government. It was made to help
developers within the U.S. government design and build fast, accessible,
mobile-friendly government websites backed by user research.

I started on this project during its pre-1.0 phase. During my time on this
project, I worked on the continuous integration and delivery of the software. I
helped in the release of the framework, in the documentation, and evangelizing
of the design system among my federal government peers.

Being a part of an agile team also allowed me to contribute to the user-research
portion of the project. I regularly participated in user interviews &
synthesizing it into actionable stories that me and my fellow engineers and
designers could implement.

Because the USWDS is also open-source software, I was regularly answering and
reviewing user contributions from outside of our team. With over 4k stargazers
on GitHub, the project regularly gets a lot of traffic from folks needing help
or contributing to the project.

[Here's all of the work open-sourced on GitHub][gh-link].
