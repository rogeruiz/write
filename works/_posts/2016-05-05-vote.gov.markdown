I worked on vote.gov before the 2016 election. My main role on this project was
to ensure the developer productivity and adherence to the US Web Design System.
The site is built using a static-generator and an asset-pipeline to allow
front-end focused engineers to leverage any compatible technologies that they
need.

As a native Spanish speaker, I also contributed to the translation on the site
along with integrating i18n translation customization before it was
fully-supported in upstream for the Hugo project.

Also, since this was work I did while I was in public sector, [all of the work is
open-sourced on GitHub][gh-link].
