I worked on Federal Front Door research project. This website is considered a
micro-site and helped citizens learn more about the research work Labs.USA.gov
was conducting. Most of my work is in the asset pipeline and continuous
deployment of the static website.

Also, since this was work I did while I was in public sector, [all of the work is
open-sourced on GitHub][gh-link].
