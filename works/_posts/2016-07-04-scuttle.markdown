### Description

At work, Scuttle was so popular that folks on the [cloud.gov][cg] team were
impressed enough to make it a part of the compliance documentation. With some
minor tweaking, like a hand-crafted legend due to time constraints, the project
was a success with the auditors. The diagrams are still available [at the
official address for cloud.gov diagrams][cg-diagrams].
