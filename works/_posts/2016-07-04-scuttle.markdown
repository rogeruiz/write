### Description

I built and continue to maintain Scuttle as an open source project. The idea
behind Scuttle was to add the US Web Design System to the output of Mermaid
diagrams. The regular output of Mermaid diagrams wasn't as visually pleasing as
I wanted it to be and my work on [USWDS][uswds] was good enough for what I was
trying to achieve here. I successfully implemented a Gulp plugin to process the
Mermaid text kept in different files and adding it to the HTML file templates
for each page.
