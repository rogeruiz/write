### Description

I'm going to my first tech conference in September 2017 and it's gonna be [The
Strange Loop][tsl]. This kind of one-off site is a meditation process I go
through when I whenever I'm visiting a new city or locale.

[tsl]: https://thestrangeloop.com

The idea is that these sort of **list** projects are meditative because they
have a clear beginning, middle, end life-cycle. They're also really helpful for
paying down emotional labor before a long trip. They allow me to concentrate
on a focused itinerary rather than be overwhelmed by a lot of different choices.
It's also super helpful since these are small-scale programming exercises.
