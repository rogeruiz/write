### Description

I like to vacation in the Pacific Northwest from time-to-time. There is something
in the air out there, and being 30-40 minutes away from a national park is a real
treat. When I wasn't looking for nature, the bars and nightlife were pretty cool
there too.

I made a list of places I recommend checking out if you are more interested in the
nightlife.

This project was also my first foray into UX for hidden mobile navigations. The
idea here was to create a mobile navigation that worked like native design patterns.
