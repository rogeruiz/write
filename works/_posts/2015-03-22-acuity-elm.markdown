Heavy use of the flexible box-model allowed for this website to have a fully-
responsive experience which looks great at any size. Custom post types allowed
for scalable-publishing of new employees and new products. This was one of my
first dives into WordPress development. I found myself really constrained by
the system of tools I was afforded on the project and my surface level of knowledge
about WordPress' event-based architecture.

It did not however put a bad taste in my mouth for WordPress or its value in and
out of developer culture. I saw clearly both the power and the range of community
members that love WordPress.

Because of the power behind WordPress and its community, I was struck hard with
the harsh reality of content strategy being such a high priority. Everything needs
content, and everyone needs an editor.
