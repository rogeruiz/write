In 2011, JetBlue made Rokkan Agency of Record (AOR). As the AOR, we had to
redesign their main website. Since then, I've worked both as a part of a team
and as project lead in the development of the booking engine, TrueBlue redesign,
and the recently launched TrueBlue Family Pooling point-sharing program.

This project had me cut my teeth on a lot of new techniques. Over the course of
1.5 years and 795 commits, I've learn a lot about working with off-shore teams,
jQuery UI, Compass project integration, and RequireJS.

This was one of my first projects as a newly hired junior developer at Rokkan.
I owe a lot to the technical director at the time, Andrew. He was a really great
mentor and everything I learned have lead me to learn more and more about web
development and writing software for people with people.
