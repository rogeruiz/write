### Roger is working

I started this [Tumblr][roger-is-working] about a week or two after I started
working at [18F][eighteenf]. This had been my second foray into remote-work life
and I was starting to really miss some of the aspects of checking into an office
building everyday and having living-breathing humans around me that weren't my
living-breathing family.

So I considered it important to start doing this **publicly**.

I had found out about `lolcommits` from the [Meetup's Hack && Tell]
[mu-hack-and-tell] in NYC back in 2011. I had been mesmerized by how simple the
concept of tagging your likeness to a commit would make for better signing of
commits than a GPG key. It made what I do on the computer more approachable.

I would tell friends that I hacked on something over the weekend, and didn't
have anything to show for it. It was either a script or a tweak to my system
that I couldn't really show off. But showing people a series of pictures taken
while I was working on said thing was always easier to show off. More human too.

So I continued from job to job collecting `.lolcommit/*.jpg` along the way.
