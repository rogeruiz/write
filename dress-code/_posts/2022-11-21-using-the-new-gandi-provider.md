The new Gandi Terraform provider dropped on the 30th of September, 2022. I can't
remember where I read the news from but this is pretty good news for me. Now I
can start managing my DNS records using Terraform. I'd done this at 18F back in
my time there and now that my DNS registrar has a Terraform provider I'm aware
of, I decided to give it a shot.

[‚û°Ô∏è  Checkout the Gandi Terraform provider on the Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/go-gandi/gandi/2.2.0)

I've used Gandi for a long time as my personal choice in DNS providers. And if
you happen to use Gandi as your domain registrar, then this should help you dive
right in. And if you're not that's okay too. You might learn something from
this, but I can't promise anything.
