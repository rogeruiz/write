> `tl;dr` macOS-based Night mode supported scripting to modify the configuration across multiple development environment tools including: [Alacritty][alacritty], [Tmux][tmux], [Neovim][neovim], [Starship][starship], and [Bat][bat].

This post has been cooking for a long time. The ability to switch between visual modes across all my tooling always felt like an attainable goal but for years it was outside of my periphery because my main tools were not Unix philosophy aligned.

Here‚Äôs an excerpt from the original authors.

Now the Unix philosophy is thrown around a lot. I recommend reading it every now and then. It‚Äôs historic information and the perspective gained from rereading it is super helpful. I‚Äôve also learned that not many people are aware of the Unix philosophy by name. So I hope showing you how using macOS Night mode to trigger theme changes across multiple tools at once helps enforce parts of the Unix philosophy in modern times.

## The visual problem

When I‚Äôm on the computer, I tend to work in Dark themes in my editor and terminal. For me, these are the same things and expand further to tools like my multiplexer, command prompt framework, and TUI. The problems I experience are whenever I work outside during daylight hours it is almost impossible to work outside. My monitor on my laptop is glossy and turns into a reflective surface when my Dark themes are activated.

I use a lot of tools that subscribe to the Unix philosophy to varying degrees. For a Terminal I‚Äôve used [iTerm2][iterm2] for almost a decade but I just switched to Alacritty. I recently switched from OhMyZSH to Starship for my command prompt. I used to use Vim but made the big leap to learn Lua and Neovim earlier this year. I‚Äôve also made a big switch to Rust-based tools like Bat to get a different visual user experience compared to Cat.

## The configuration problem 

My most used terminal throughout the years has been iTerm2. I love the customization and the attention to detail you find in the configuration. It‚Äôs a Mac-first application and does a good job of maintaining the HIG or allowing users to customize it further on their own. It‚Äôs all accessible with a very intuitive UI-based settings page. Configurations can even be exported and imported to XML files to make sharing them easy.

## Text-based configurations are better than proprietary ones

Most of the tools I use every day use text based configuration files such as customized `.conf` files or Yaml or TOML files too. This is also super helpful to me to be able to back these things up. 

Even though iTerm2 allows for exports and imports of configuration, the interface isn‚Äôt text-first. It‚Äôs visual first. Which is great if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre in to.

### I had to stop using iTerm2 and start using Alacritty

While I‚Äôve used iTerm2 for so long, I did run in to various limitations. They were mostly around configuration management. There were times where I would make an update and I would have close and open the window for it to take effect. Other times, I would have to manually enter my theme and tweak my configuration using the UI editor. While all this worked for me for years, I needed to try something better. I switched to Alacritty and haven‚Äôt looked back. While it‚Äôs not as feature-rich as iTerm2 if you‚Äôre looking for lots of features, it does have a text-based configuration written in Yaml that updates the terminal on save.

The Alacritty project has stated publicly that they‚Äôre looking to only recreate the terminal emulation experience and nothing else. That‚Äôs okay for me as I use Tmux to modify my terminal experience. But as usual, your mileage may vary. Explore your options. If Alacritty interests you then please keep reading.
