This post has been cooking for a long time. The ability to switch between visual
modes across all my tooling always felt like an attainable goal but for years it
was outside my periphery because my main tools weren't Unix philosophy aligned.

Here‚Äôs an excerpt from the original authors.

I like to reference the Unix philosophy a lot. I recommend reading it every now
and then. It‚Äôs historic information and the perspective gained from rereading it
is super helpful. I've learned that people aren't aware of the Unix philosophy
by name. I hope showing you how using macOS Night mode to trigger theme changes
across different tools at once helps enforce parts of the Unix philosophy in
modern times.

## The visual problem

When I‚Äôm on the computer, I tend to work in Dark themes in my editor and
terminal. For me, these are the same things and expand further to tools like my
multiplexer, command prompt framework, and TUI. The problems I experience are
when I work outside during daylight hours it's almost impossible to work
outside. The display on my laptop is glossy and turns into a reflective surface
when I use my Dark themes.

I use a lot of tools that subscribe to the Unix philosophy to varying degrees.
For a Terminal I‚Äôve used [iTerm2][iterm2] for almost a decade but I switched to
Alacritty. I switched from OhMyZSH to Starship for my command prompt. I used to
use Vim but made the big leap to learn Lua and Neovim earlier this year. I‚Äôve
made a big switch to Rust-based tools like Bat to get a different visual user
experience compared to Cat.

## The configuration problem 

My terminal throughout the years has been iTerm2. I love the customization and
the attention to detail you find in the configuration. It‚Äôs a Mac-first
application and does a good job of maintaining the HIG or allowing users to
customize it further on their own. It‚Äôs all accessible with an intuitive
UI-based settings page. Configurations get exported and imported to XML
files to make sharing them easy.

## Text-based configurations are better than proprietary ones

The tools I use every day use text based configuration files such as customized
`.conf` files or Yaml or TOML files. This is super helpful to me to be able to
back these things up in version control.

Even though iTerm2 allows for exports and imports of configuration, the
interface isn‚Äôt text-first. It‚Äôs visual first. Which is great if that‚Äôs what
you‚Äôre in to.

### I had to stop using iTerm2 and start using Alacritty

While I‚Äôve used iTerm2 for over seven years, I did run in to various
limitations. They were around configuration management. There were times where I
would make an update and I would have to close and open the window for it to
take effect. Other times, I would have to manually enter my theme and tweak my
configuration using the UI editor. While all this worked for me for years, I
needed to try something better. I switched to Alacritty and haven‚Äôt looked back
yet. While it‚Äôs not as feature-rich as iTerm2 if you‚Äôre looking for lots of
features, it does have a text-based configuration written in Yaml that updates
the terminal on save.

[‚û°Ô∏è  Checkout my Alacritty configuration](https://git.sr.ht/~rogeruiz/.files/tree/main/item/alacritty/alacritty.yml)

The Alacritty project has stated publicly that they‚Äôre looking to recreate the
terminal emulation experience and nothing else. That‚Äôs okay for me as I use Tmux
to augment my terminal experience. But as usual, your mileage may vary. Explore
your options. If Alacritty interests you then please keep reading.

## Next up, I said what I sed

[‚û°Ô∏è  The stream editor `sed`](https://manpages.org/sed)

This little Unix program is the best. I love `sed` and that might be because I
learned regular expressions by learning Pearl and finding and replacing text
made me laugh when I realized what the acronym sounded like. F A R T. Editing
text on the fly is so dope. This is how `sed` made its way into this solution. I
hope it makes you realize the same thing.

```bash
sed -E -i '' \
	"s/^(colors: \*).+$/\1${current_mode}/" \
	~/.alacritty.yml
```

Making sure that I capture the correct part of the key/value pair for what I‚Äôm
editing I am able to set it to the `$current_mode` coming from the PLIST macOS
sets when triggering Night Mode.

```bash
sed -E -i '' \
	"s/^(set.background = ).+$/\1\"${current_mode}\"/" \
	~/.config/nvim/lua/theme.lua
```

```bash
sed -E -i '' \
	"s/^(palette = ).+$/\1\"${current_mode}\"/" \
	~/.config/starship.toml
```

Now there can be an issues where maybe a different name gets used, and that‚Äôs
okay too. It‚Äôs easy to just set another variable like `$catppuccin_flavour` and
use it the same way.

```bash
sed -E -i '' \
	"s/^(set -g @catppuccin_flavour ).+$/\1'${catppuccin_flavour}'/" \
	~/.tmux.conf
# source the config so it forces reloading
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```

Since these configuration files all use the same text-based interface for
configuring the theme, then I am able to use simple Unix tools to edit text
and save the document. The `sed` tool great for just that.

With the `-E` flag, I‚Äôm able to run enhanced regular expressions. I do this
because I need to run positional capture to match the key rather than the value
since I don‚Äôt know what it will be. Or better said, I shouldn't care about
specifics. I should care what I want it to be. I also need to make sure that I
capture the rest of the text in the value after the key‚Äôs definition too with
`.+$`.

Now since I used parentheses around the key and assignment operator (`=`,
`<space>`, or `:`), I can then use `\1` to place it where it‚Äôs needed to set the
correct value.

All this and it‚Äôs clear to see the values of using the Unix philosophy to manage
the APIs between various tooling.
